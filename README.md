# Basic Mobile Calculator using Python Tkinter

## Overview
This repository contains a basic calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and adheres to the BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) rules for evaluating expressions. It also includes error handling to manage invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
- **BODMAS Rule Handling:** Accurately evaluates expressions according to the BODMAS rules.
- **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and prevent crashes.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.
4. Install the required packages.

## Usage
1. Run the application.
2. Use the buttons on the GUI to input your mathematical expression.
3. The calculator will display the result following the BODMAS rules and handle any errors gracefully.

## Code Overview
- **GUI Design:** The GUI consists of an `Entry` widget to display the expression and result, and buttons for digits and operations.
- **Main Functions:**
  - Updating the expression with clicked button values.
  - Clearing the current expression.
  - Evaluating the expression and displaying the result.
